# mirai-jni-rs
A QQ bot framework built with Rust and Kotlin, based on [mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai).

This framework still needs a lot of work to be completed. Its APIs are quite incomplete.

## How does it work
Simple. It uses <abbr title="Java Native Interface">JNI</abbr> to connect Rust and JVM.

By doing so, Rust can directly access APIs provided by mirai. Keep it high-performance.

## Usage
Developer guide will follow up soon.

## Contributing
We welcome all kinds of contributions, the contribution guide will follow up soon.
